# Lab: Property card

1. *Fork* the repository, then *clone* the new repository to your local computer.
2. Take the sample composition below and annotate the elements and layers using the graphic software of your choice. Consider the visual representation of each later or component, while also noting the element type and providing an appropriate class name (or classes) for each, at minimum
3. Recreate the card using semantic HTML and CSS, using the techniques learned to this point about information architecture, design systems, and best practices in HTML/CSS.
4. Consider where a button that says "Learn more" would be placed. Design and code it to link to the current page, but imagine it would be used to link to the full property listing.
5. Replicate the item to create 6-8 separate cards, modifying the information within each to make them all look unique. For at least half of the items, increase the number of listed amenities (for example, "2 Car Garage", "Finished Basement", etc) so that some cards are taller than others.
6. Layout the cards in a responsive grid so that the cards are each displayed in the best possible dimensions, regardless of the viewport width.
